# Overlord Clients

Main repository for all clients distributed by the Overlord Server on
our primary domain [www.easter.company](https://www.easter.company).

## Clients

The `Global` client stores core data and site header information which imports data from
the other clients and serves them from within its body. Some clients may be standalone
such as the `Chat` client which is used for both embedded chat windows across the platform
and as a seperate standalone application for messaging.
